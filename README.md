# cis1051-project
Proposal for project

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO:
My idea is to create a crypto currency Price Tracker, where a user will input a cryptcurrency name or ticker and the program will display a the current price of the coin. As an extension, the user will input a certain percent discount they'd like to see on the coin and the program will notify the user when the price of that coin reaches that value. An ambitious idea for this is to also include an associated graph of price or other indicators for a coin, but this is not a priority.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO:
I will be doing this project alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO:
If I include the nptification idea, will the program only allot me a certain time to run it until it has a time error? What I mean is that if the program is meant to monitor price and is looking for a certain price, it may take time and I know that sometimes time errors can occur. I was wondering if there was anything I could do to bypass it.

# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Cryptocurrency Price Tracker

TODO

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This program will take user input and ask for a crypto coin to be analyzed. This coin's price will be shown and the user can choose a discounted price they want for the coin.

TODO

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

Using an API, the software can take an inputted coin name and find the price. I will have select crypto coins that will be available to choose from. The code will then prompt the user to input a percent discount they would like the coin to be. If the coin reaches that point, then the user can be notified of that price. In addition, possible other features, such as viewing marketcap can be applied and will be shown only if the user wants to see it. After one coin is analyzed, then the user has a choice to end the program or look at anoteher coin.
TODO

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable NA

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable NA

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will accomplish the price display as well as selection criteria for whether they want to view other features or not. Additionally, I will make sure the user can choose more coins to analyze instead of just one.
TODO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: Ideally, I can get the program to run and continuously track the price until the user's desired price is reached.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO: I can have my program notify the user of the price desired. Also include a price graph.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research what an API is and how to use it with Python. I will need to learn what functions the API has and how to download and use the request library. After the basic input functions will need to be done and after I will need to research how to get notifications through a python program. Another important step would be to learn how to make graphs via python and what programs work best to accomplish this task.  Lastly, I need to acquire some patience and stay resilient in this endeavor.

### POST PROJECT REFLECTION:
After completing this project, I would like to recount ont he difficultiees and cahllenges overcome to complete this piece. Although my final project is not truly
what I wanted it to be, I think it embodies the hard work and skills I have done to finish it. I wanted to make a price tracker with notifications instead of just
a price finder, however, due to technilogical issues, such as pip not working properly and an apparent old version of python, I could not dwonlad necesary libraries
such as telegram and os, to accomplish the notifications part. However, in this process, I have become learned and become much more familair with the Mac terminal. 
I have learned the usefulness it contains and look forward to continue using it. Despite not being able to complete the ideal rendtion of my project, I still 
thoroughly enjoyed creating the current version. I learned how to use some of the requests library as well as what an API is and how to use it. I got to exersice 
skills used from the semester and applied them in this project. Some other difficulties I had that I persevered through were API formatting and API data manipulation. This was also very difficult and at a point I almost left the API data as is instead of formatting it. Prior to figuring out how to format/ manipulate the data, when inputing a certian coin and fiat currency (lets use bitcoin and usd as an example for not) it would display as {'bitcoin', 'usd': price, 'Market_cap: xxxx} or something like that. This was not pleasing to see so I eventually was able to figure out how to manipulate the data using requests and json. Additionally, when adding the percent change, using the .format was something I learned to do in order to reduce the number of decimal places from around 12-14 to 2 decimal places. In fact, finding a good Api in general was a tedious task, but luckily the coingecko one did the job and worked well for this projecy (some others requried payemnt or signup).Also, I learned to find bugs more efficently and used functions more than I have previously. Practicing these skills made coding easier and more fun. I really enjoyed navigating the API, and adding the choose the fiat currency feature. This project, truly did test my coding capabilities and I feel that I delivered. In the future, I plan on adding the notification feature to this (I have a genral idea of how to do it, but the needed libraries will not download). Overall, I learned to be ambitous, stay resileint  and focused when coding. Although things did not turn out ideal in the end, I was very proud of what I accomplished. Considering I am really interested in Crypto and I think it has a bright future, this was fun.
