# cis1051-project
Proposal for project

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

TODO:
My idea is to create a crypto currency Price Tracker, where a user will input a cryptcurrency name or ticker and the program will display a the current price of the coin. As an extension, the user will input a certain percent discount they'd like to see on the coin and the program will notify the user when the price of that coin reaches that value. An ambitious idea for this is to also include an associated graph of price or other indicators for a coin, but this is not a priority.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

TODO:
I will be doing this project alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

TODO:
If I include the nptification idea, will the program only allot me a certain time to run it until it has a time error? What I mean is that if the program is meant to monitor price and is looking for a certain price, it may take time and I know that sometimes time errors can occur. I was wondering if there was anything I could do to bypass it.
